This is a test post but I'm working on this new blog site for myself.
I'm really tired right now as it's like 1am but I'm going to try to
finish this up soon.

I'll mostly be covering things I'm working on, thing's I'm learning, and
other things that I find interesting all over the internet. Personally, I'm a
pretty boring person so I don't think I'll have much to say. I'll try to
write more. This is a link to [my github](https://github.com/is-it-ayush).

Links, are cool. but what about code?

```tsx
import React from "react";

const Hello = () => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```

It's alright but I'd rather have more content. What about line codes.
`function hello() { console.log("Hello World"); }`.

What else can I do? Let's see, what about lists?

-   This is a list
-   This is another list
-   This is a third list

Let's do something else. I'm going to try to make a table.
| Name | Age | Hobby |
| ---- | --- | ------- |
| Ayush | 20 | Programming |
| Bob | 21 | Sleeping |
| Alice | 22 | Eating |

What about a footnote?[^1]

[^1]: This is a footnote.

Okay, this is cool. Let's try to make a shareable link. I'm going to try to
make a link to a heading that can be copied.

### Ha, Gotcha!

This is a great heading. I'm going to try to make a link to this heading.
Okay, Now some Straight facts coming at you. ~~The world is flat.~~ **_Ahem_**, I
mean, the world is round.
