This is a test post for my new blog site. I'm really tired right now
as it's like 1am but I'm going to try to finish this up soon.

I'll mostly be covering things I'm working on, thing's I'm learning, and
other things that I find interesting all over the internet. Personally, I'm a
pretty boring person so I don't think I'll have much to say. I'll try to
write more. This is a link to [my github](https://github.com/is-it-ayush). Hehe,
I just tested out a link. I'm sneaky :D \***_wears protection goggles_**\*. Get Ready,
We're going to test out some mardown.

Let's begin with something beatufiful. I'm going to try to make a code block.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Hello = () => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```

Now, Let's try some inline code. `const hello = "Hello World";`. Inline code is
pretty cool as you can highlight short pieces of code. Now, let's get to the
good stuff. I'm going to try to make a quote.

What else can I do? Let's see, what about lists?

- This is a list
- This is another list
- This is a third list

Ah, Let's take a break & enjoy some text after this list. You know, I couldn't really
get code blocks to work with dark mode. Specially the shiki rehype plugin. So, I used
a simple trick. On top of a theme that I stumbled upon. I added a `filter: invert(3%)` to
the `pre` tag on dark mode.

For light mode, It's a simple `filter: invert(98%) hue-rotate(180deg);`. This is a
pretty cool trick. It's not perfect but thanks this issue on [Typescript-Website](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/pull/1536)
repo for providing a fit-in solution. Ight, time to test some more markdown.

This is a table. It's a little stupid, but i'll rarely use it (i'll fix it later :3).
| Name | Age | Hobby |
| ---- | --- | ------- |
| Ayush | 20 | Programming |
| Bob | 21 | Sleeping |
| Alice | 22 | Eating |

Okay, This is something I'll never use, because this is the kind of stuff you find on
a wiki or arxvi papers. Did you guess it, Lol, It's a footnote[^1]. What else did you expect?
Equations? You silly duck :D

Nice! Markdown is cool. I've also tried superscript and subscript. They're unfortunately
not supported by the markdown parser I'm using. I'll try to fix it later too maybe. I think
the last thing I'll try is a heading.

### The Great Heading.

This is a great heading (literally). Now some Straight facts coming at you.
~~The world is flat.~~ **_Ahem_**, I meant the world is round.

[^1]: Ah, GO away!! This isn't a research paper. It's a blog post.
