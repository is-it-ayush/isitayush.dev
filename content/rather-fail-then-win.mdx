I believe there are infinite ways to solve a problem. This means there
exists an "infinite solution set" consisting of your theoretical +
practical solutions for a given problem. Imagine this infinite solution
set as a 2D rectangle. I'll refer to this rectange as the **problem space**.
If you think even harder you'll realize that all real life problems
we currently/will face will only ever have a "finite solution set"
due to our civilizational and technological limitations. Imagine
this as another 2D rectangle within the **problem space** and
I'll refer this space as **unconstrained-solution space**. The more
you constrain this unconstrained space to the specifics of the problem
at your hand, the closer you'll get to another smaller space within
**unconstrained-solution space** which I'll refer to as the
**solution space**. If I visualize this, you'll end up with something
close to the below image.

All solutions to a particular real life problem can be represented
in above three space's whereas a solution itself can either be "correct"
that is **you've won and solved the problem** or "wrong" that is **you've
lost and failed to solve the problem**.
- Consider the case of **winning**. If you win, that is if you find
yourself **within the solution space** at your first attempt of
solving a given problem. You'll have no idea about the respective
boundaries/edges the **problem space** and the **unconstrained-solution space**
(rectangles).
- Consider the case of **failing**. If you fail, that is if you find
yourself **outside of solution space** and inside of either **problem
space** or **unconstrained-solution space**. You'll get a chance to
explore the boundaries of either of these spaces.

In my perspective, **winning** has a negative impact on the problem
at your hand since the solution works and you call it a day whereas
**failing/struggling** has a positive impact on the problem at your
hand as you explore and map out the spaces. I also find it
fun to explore and reach various unintended solutions that I wasn't
meant to reach. I've been doing it from the days I used to play games
and stumble upon "easter eggs" placed by the game developers to today,
where I use this thought model for almost all of my problems that I
try to solve. Here my internal curiousity plays a huge role here and acts as a guide
which helps me map out solutions to my problems the above three spaces.

I wrote this for people who struggle and think they're not capable
enough to solve a given problem. I've been there and you can actually
solve everything you put your mind too. I hope it helps you next
time you solve a problem.

& **I'd rather fail than win**. It's is a lot more fun.
