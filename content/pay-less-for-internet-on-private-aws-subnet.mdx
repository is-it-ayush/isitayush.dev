i've only started giving a damn about aws since 2024
but i'm gonna be honest it's pricey for small and
medium sized business. how to get the best value out in
limited money? well i've got a trick for u i learnt
in my dumb experimentations last year.

### problem.

suppose i have an aws vpc cidr block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
i then carve out 2 subnets from it i.e. `10.0.0.0/24` for
my public instances and `10.16.0.0/24` for my private
instances.

all instances on public subnet get assigned
a public ip and thus are accessible from the internet &
can access the internet. this is **in contrast** to all
instances on private subnet which in their default state
are **air-gapped** i.e. you can neither access these
instances from the internet nor access the internet
from these instances.

well how do you solve this? the costly aws solution is
to deploy a _managed NAT gateway_ which costs ~
**41 USD/month** or ~ **492 USD/year** in `ap-south-1`
region.

### solution.

well i would like to save money so here's the trick.
a project called [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/)
creates a proxy instance (a `t4g.nano`) for traffic
directed towards the internet from your private
instances. this is a uni-directional channel or in
network terms a NAT. [here's how you can deploy this
project in your VPC](https://fck-nat.dev/stable/deploying/#manual-web-console).
this documentation also has terraform & cloudformation
instructions.

> i really recommend the manual deployment so you

the `t4g.nano` instance costs ~ **1 USD/month** or
**12 USD/year**. compare this to your previous costs of
~ 492 USD/year from _managed NAT gateway_. you save ~
**480 USD/year** or about **97.5% savings**. yipeeeee!!

### bonus tips.

1. you can deploy multiple fck-nat instances
   on different availability zones to create a highly
   available outbound infra for your private instances.
   i haven't experiemented with it but it should be
   possible.
2. you can also use fck-nat instances as a bastion
   host to connect to instance on private subnet from
   your computer at home/office. i've tried it, it
   works flawlessly.
