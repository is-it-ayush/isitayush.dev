### Introduction

If you're like me, then questions are something that I can't really
sleep with. There is this drive inside my head to figure out how
things work and why they work the way they do. I'm not sure if this
is a good thing or a bad thing, but it's something that I've grown
to accept & like.

One of the questions that I've had for a while now is how does a
provider like Github know that the commits that I'm pushing to my
repositories are actually mine? I don't recall setting up
anything to prove my identity. I don't even recall logging
in with a password. So how does Github know that I'm
who I claim to be?

I somehow knew the answer but still searched the internet to verify it &
it turns out I was right. After thinking a little bit, It all settled in
my head. Hang tight, I'll explain it to you & I hope it'll make sense
to you as well.

### What's going on?

Tools like [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) cli are supposed to be universal
i.e. they're supposed to work with any provider. Accounts on the other hand
are provider specific, It doesn't make sense for `git` to know about
your Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket account. So, It cannot verify that you are
what you say you are.

This check falls back to the provider who actually hosts both your
account & the repository (hopefully). If the commit history meta has
your email & name. Github or any other provider can look up your
account in it's database & display the commits as yours otherwise
it simply displays the name & the email associated with the commit.

### But, what if someone else pushes commits with my email & name?

Now a question you might quickly come up with is, What if a bad actor
decides to push commits with your email & name? Will Github still
display the commits as yours?

Unfortunately, **yes**. Here's an example of a commit that I pushed
to my repository. One without editing the email & name. And the other
by making my email & name to Jhon Doe.

<Image

  alt="The `chore: init` is the commit that I pushed without changing the email & name. The `chore: add hi` was the commit where I changed my name & email to Jhon Doe."
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

I was able to successfully push the commit with my name & email changed to
Jhon Doe. Had the email & name were registered I'd also get a redirect to
their profile inside Github without them ever knowing. It's scary to know
that someone can make commits on your behalf & while we can't really stop someone
from doing this. We can infact, can make it more obvious.

### How do we make it more obvious?

This is where [`gpg`](https://gnupg.org/) steps in. There are two things we could
do:

- We could sign our commits with a private key.
- We could tell our provider to always flag commits associated with our email that aren't
  signed with a `Unverified` badge.

This way, if someone tries to push commits with our email & name. One can easily
determine that github cannot verify the authenticity of the commit by simply looking
at the `Unverified` badge.

If you look at the above image. You'll also notice the `Unverified`
badge show up on my `chore: init` commit. I intentionally didn't sign the commit with
my private key to show you how it looks like.

### Okay, Teach me how to set this up.

Well, I am not really great at explaining things. Hence, I recommend you to read the
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
for setting up `gpg` with Github. It's pretty straight forward &
easy to follow. For other providers such as Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.
I'm hoping the process to be similar.

### Some extra tips.

A few more things I'd recommend you to do:

- Make sure you key is atleast 4096 bits long.
- Make sure you key is backed up in atleast 2 places.

Here's a [gpg cheatsheet](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/) that
will help you find commands quickly.

### Bonus

GPG is not just limited to signing commits. You can also use it to encrypt
your files & messages & make sure that only the intended recipient can
decrypt them. You can also use it to sign your emails & make sure that
they are not tampered with.

You can also upload your public key to a keyserver so that others can
verify your identity. There is so much to talk about but I'll wrap it up
here. Maybe someday, I'll write a dedicated post about it. Till then,
