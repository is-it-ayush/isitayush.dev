If you work in software, You would've definitely connected to a remote machine
running on the cloud like aws, gcp, azure, etc. or running locally on your own
computer through virtualization technologies like qemu/kvm, hyperv,vmware, etc.
with SSH. Typically, An SSH session flow looks like this: `Connect -> Do Task ->
Disconnect`.

**Do you know that SSH can do more than this?** I'll cover a few problems I found
myself in and how SSH saved my day.

### copy something from remote machine to local machine.

I ran a diagnostic tool on my remote machine and it generated a bunch of log files
in my home directory on the remote machine. These files were too many to analyze
remotely so I wanted to copy them from the remote machine to my local computer.
**How do I do it?** I had several options but all of them involved uploading the logs
somwhere on the internet from my remote machine and then downloading the logs onto
my local machine. **What if my logs were sensitive and I don't want to expose them
to the bad internet?**

Enter SSH! I found out you can just do,
```sh
# command: structure of the command
scp <username>@<remote_ip>:<absolute_remote_file_path> <relative_or_absolute_local_file_path>

# example: this would copy the file from remote path /home/ayush/sysdump.tar.gz to your current local directory.
scp ayush@10.0.191.144:/home/ayush/sysdump.tar.gz ./sysdump.tar.gz
```

### access a service running on remote machine without exposing it to the internet.

The same diagnostic tool I ran previously on the remote macine had a web dashboard
feature. I ran the dashboard on the remote machine and it was listening on `0.0.0.0:80`.
The problem was that this remote machine was completely isolated from the public
internet with the only exception that I was allowed to connect to it via SSH.
Therefore I couldn't just port forward the port `80` on my remote machine and access the
dashboard through the public internet. So, **How do I access the dashboard without messing
with any network settings?**

Enter SSH! I found out you can just do,
```sh
# command: structure of the the command
ssh -N -L <local_port>:<remote_server_bind_address>:<remote_server_ip>

# example: here the dashboard was listening on 0.0.0.0 &
# port 80 on remote machine
ssh -N -L 80:0.0.0.0:80 ayush@10.0.191.144

# few more examples
# - what if you have more than one service on remote machine?
# ssh has you covered! you can expose as many services as you like.
ssh -N -L 80:0.0.0.0:80 -L 5432:0.0.0.0:5432 -L 21:0.0.0.0:21 ayush@10.0.191.144

# - this also works for remote kubernetes services, say your service
# is running on 69.96.0.32 and port 443. you could do,
ssh -N -L 443:69.96.0.32:443 ayush@10.0.191.144
```

I was then able to access the dashboard as if it was running on my local machine via `localhost:80`.

### so...now what?

Well! That's it. I hope you learnt something new. SSH is nice and now you can use these commands
if you ever run into these situations. Thank you for reading. \<3
